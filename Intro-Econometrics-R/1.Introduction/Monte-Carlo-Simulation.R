# Of course, in the real world our data is often a random sample from a well-defined population 
# and we don't know the population parameters and instead use the sample to estimate them. 

# Using a compu
# This is a little strange, so we want to take noisy estimate of something we already know, and then
# we are able to study the behavior of our estimator very well.
